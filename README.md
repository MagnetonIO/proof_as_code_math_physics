## Introduction
The `proof_as_code_math_physics` project is a Haskell-based framework that unifies **mathematics, physics, and computer science** through the **Proof as Code** paradigm. This project leverages **type theory, category theory, and functional programming** to encode and verify mathematical theorems, physical laws, and quantum mechanics principles as executable programs. 

By treating **proofs as programs** and **theorems as type-checked functions**, this project ensures that mathematical reasoning and physical laws are enforced at the type level, eliminating ambiguity and human error in theoretical formulations.

### Key Features
- **Formal Verification of Proofs**: Ensures correctness through Haskell's powerful type system.
- **Mathematics Meets Computation**: Encodes mathematical theorems as type-safe constructs.
- **Physics in Type Theory**: Models quantum mechanics, superposition, entanglement, and the no-cloning theorem.
- **Quantum Error Correction as Code**: Provides a formalized approach to error detection and correction in quantum computing.
- **Executable Proofs**: Ensures that any incorrect logical or physical operation fails at compile time.

## Architecture Overview
The `proof_as_code_math_physics` project is built entirely in **Haskell**, using advanced type system features such as:
- **GADTs (Generalized Algebraic Data Types)**
- **Dependent Types (via Type Families)**
- **Linear Types (to enforce quantum constraints)**
- **Category Theory Constructs (Monoidal, Braided Categories for Quantum Gates)**

The project models mathematical theorems, physics equations, and quantum computational logic as Haskell types and functions, ensuring that computations strictly adhere to theoretical constraints.
